Out of the saddle with everything you’ve got at the end. \nKnow that the adrenaline and rest will probably make your previous PR number seem too easy at the start. Stay in control and have a plan of how to build into the effort. \nIf you’re not already on The Breakaway, you should start a free trial before your PR attempt so you can see the ride analysis from an all-out effort.\n \nAnd be sure to hop into our Facebook community and let us know how it goes!

Add shallot and cook, stirring, until softened with no color, about 2 minutes. Stir in garlic until fragrant, 30 seconds. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon butter and stir until melted, then add flour and cook, stirring constantly, until flour is light golden but the shallots still have no color, about 3 minutes. While whisking constantly, drizzle in milk and cream until smooth, and season with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer, then add chopped spinach and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, until the spinach is totally incorporated and the sauce is thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in sour cream until combined. Transfer to a bowl and serve warm."

Introduction (Act 1)\n\nKATE, a successful social media influencer, sets off for a weekend retreat with her two friends, JAMES and LUCY, who help manage her brand.\nThe trio arrives at the secluded cabin in their car, looking forward to a relaxing weekend and brainstorming content ideas.\nTo capture the picturesque environment, Kate posts a photo of the cabin on social media, inadvertently revealing their location.\nThe post catches the attention of her fans, or \"stans,\" who begin making their way to the cabin.\nII. Rising Action (Act 2)\n\nAs the group settles in, they notice the first stan, OLIVIA, wandering nearby, exhibiting subtle signs of psychosis.\nThe trio is initially confused but brushes it off as a coincidence, unaware of the incoming danger.\nMore stans arrive, their behavior becoming increasingly erratic and disturbing, displaying delusions, hallucinations, and paranoia.\nIt becomes apparent that the stans are infected by a mysterious mind-altering virus, causing their obsession with Kate to spiral out of control.\nTrapped inside the cabin, Kate, James, and Lucy grow increasingly anxious as they observe the stans lurking around the property, peering in through windows and trying doors.\nWhile the stans remain non-aggressive, their unsettling presence and zombie-like behavior create an atmosphere of tension and fear.\nIII. Climax (Act 3)\n\nRealizing they can't stay in the cabin forever, Kate, James, and Lucy decide to make their escape using the car they arrived in.\nThey stealthily make their way to the car, but as they start the engine, the stans become aggressive, drawn by the noise.\nThe trio begins to drive away, but the aggressive mass of people swarms the car, blocking their path and clawing at the windows and doors.\nIV. Resolution (Act 4)\n\nOverwhelmed by the infected stans and unable to move the car, Kate, James, and Lucy are left with no choice but to abandon the vehicle.\nThe screen fades to black, leaving their fate uncertain, as viewers are left to ponder the consequences of their actions.\n\"Stan By Me\" is a psychological horror short film that combines elements of the paranormal to delve into the dark side of internet fame and the dangers of parasocial relationships. The story focuses on the tension created by the stans surrounding the cabin and the trio's desperate attempts to escape. With a haunting and ambiguous ending, the film leaves viewers pondering the characters' fate and reflecting on the consequences of their actions."

It’s a gamble if you get the sale.\n\nSo let’s talk about how you stand out, when you have a lot of competitors.\n\nHere’s your first steps to stand out\n3 steps to make your business stand out:\n1) Group customers by their needs\n2) Break those needs down to actionable parts\n3) Translate the parts to what you’ll do for them\nThis way, you’ll be focused on customers that your competitors aren’t, or provide value to those customers in a different way.\n\nLet’s use a real business as an example as I walk you through each step. My friend, Barrett O’Neill’s storage business, OnDemand Storage (ODS):\n1) Identify customer\nFirst, talk to your most loyal customers to see what needs they have in common.\n\nThese needs will give you an idea of what you do better than anyone else.\n\nSteal these questions to get to know their needs:\n\n“When using [our solution], what are you ultimately trying to get done or accomplish?”\n\n“Are you using multiple solutions?”\n\n“What are you trying to accomplish as you pull together multiple products and services?”\n\n“What’s the final output you’re looking for?”\n\nSource: Questions came from this Jobs to be Done website.\n\nFrom the interviews you’ll create a list of outcomes that your customers are using your solution to achieve.\n\nPhrase the outcomes as “I want to [do a task] so I can [achieve expected outcome]”\n\nFor a “task” include both the action the customer wants to do, and the object the customer wants to do it to.\n\nFor example:\nI want to store my business equipment during the summer so I can re-open my business in the fall.\n\n2) Understand what the customer values\nNow, we want to translate these needs into something your business can act on. You want to know what your customer values and how you can solve it better than anyone.\n\nBut the word “value” is so vague.\n\nBain Consulting thought the word “value” was too fluffy too. So they ran a study to break value down into it’s core elements. They found 30 “Elements of Value.”\n\nThese elements are much more concrete.\n\nHere’s why I’m so excited about this. If your customer says they want convenience what they really mean is these 4 elements:\n• Simplifies\n• Save time\n• Avoid hassle\n• Reduce effort\n\nThose 4 elements are much easier to act on! Let’s do that in the next step.\n\nUse the pyramid below to see what “value” really means to your customers (and check out this article if you want more of an explanation).\nBain’s Elements of Value\n\n3) Find values where you can win / application\nNow you take those elements and come up with ideas on how your business can solve them better than anyone.\n\nLet’s take that convenience example:\n• Simplifies\n• Save time\n• Avoid hassle\n• Reduce effort\n\nHere’s the first 3 elements as an example for OnDemand Storage (ODS):\n\nSimplifies:\nStorage is complex if the items need to be picked up from multiple locations. ODS built in-house logistic software to make the logistics simpler.\n\nSave time:\nODS can save time during initial move-in and save time during the storage period itself. A few examples: using autopay, having the facilities ready when users arrive, movers ready on arrival.\n\nAvoid hassle:\nThe big hassle for commercial storage is when they need a space too big for standard storage units, but getting their own warehouse would be too expensive.\n\nBarrett gives businesses this mid-sized storage space so they don’t need their own warehouse. Businesses don’t need insurance, employees, or a logistics network.\n\nYou don’t need a new idea\nYou’ll notice that taking care of what customers value isn’t a new idea. ODS isn’t the first business to handle logistics for you.\n\nWhat makes you different is that you understand what your customers value and message it to them so it’s clear you’re taking care of their specific needs.\n\nIn a later issue we’ll cover how you message your differentiation so that customers know what makes you different.\nApply the above unstructured data to OwnBackup, a business continuity solution for Salesforce."

This is the biggest mistake people make. No need to be fancy, keep it as simple as possible.\n\nThe setup\n\n- You are the PM of the ETA team at Uber.\n - ETA is estimated time of arrival — the number that says how far your car is\n - ETA important because not only does it tell the customer how far the car is, but it is an input into all kinds of pricing / supply planning things. So if it goes down or has issues, it’s a big deal.\n - The ETA score is generated by a service which you are the PM of. You do normal stuff like try to make it better over time and ensure it’s not broken.\n- One day the customer success team comes to you\n - They say, “hey we just realized we never told you about this data set that we have”\n - The data set is a log of all complaints submitted by users to Uber \\*\\*\\*\\*through the app.\n - E.g. “driver was rude”, “car didn’t show up”, “i got charged twice”\n - Each complaint is one row in the data set.\n - Each complaint is tagged with a category. e.g. `driver related`, `price related`, `ETA related`\n \n \n 📌 For the candidate to discover through questions:\n \n - The data is always up to date in real-time (keeping it simple)\n - There is no open text field. The columns are just `trip\\_id, time, category`\n - The data goes back historically for years\n \n \n \n\n- You have have had outage issues with the ETA system in the past and you think this data may be an opportunity to detect when there are outages.\n- The question to answer is: how can you use this data to detect outages? We want to be able to automatically wake up an engineer in the middle of the night if we detect an outage.\n📌 For the candidate to clarify through questions:\n\n- We’re not interested in fixing the issue or in root cause analysis\n- We can assume there’s a working alerting system e.g. Pagerduty\n- We don’t want to use any other data sources, just the ticket data\n\n\\*\\*\\*End of Question\\*\\*\\*"

        "input": "I have a limited company in the UK that is a property development business. It has been in operation for 20 years. In that time it has been involved in the re-development of a single property. The company entered a development agreement with the local council, the corporation of london, who are the freeholders of the property. In accordance with the Development Agreement our company has been redeveloping the building with a view to its eventual sale. Upon the sale of the building it is the intention of myself and my brother, the other shareholder, to close the company and extract the proceeds from the sale into our personal accounts. We understand that BADR may be the most tax efficient means of doing so. Is there anything in the situation as I have described it that would argue against us being able to close the company and claim BADR? Is there any other information that would be useful and that I could provide which would help to give more clarity?"
